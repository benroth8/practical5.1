## Findings/Conclusion/Next Steps

Based on the analysis of the data on coffee house coupons, I was able to identify several differences between groups that accepted the coupons and those that didn't. I'll summarize these findings in different categories.

### Number of Times Visiting Coffee House

Drivers who tended to go to the coffee house more often were also more likely to accept the coffee coupons. This seems logical; those who never or rarely go buy coffee probably just don't like coffee to begin with, so sending them coupons won't be very effective in getting them to go buy some.

### Duration Until Coupon Expires

It was clear from the data that drivers are more likely to accept the coupon if they have a day until it expires rather than if they only have 2 hours.  

### Destination

People with no urgent destination accepted the coupons at a much higher rate than people who were driving either home or to work. It makes sense that this would be the case, as people are often in a rush when driving to home or work and might not have time to stop and buy coffee, even when getting a discount. People who aren't going anywhere in particular probably have more time to stop and randomly buy coffee. 

### Time of Day

The time at which people were most likely to accept the coupons was 10 AM, followed by 2 PM, and the majority of coupons at these times were accepted. Other times of day were less effective times to send out coupons, as less than 50% of coupons sent at those times were accepted. 

### Next Steps

Based on the findings from this notebook, we can tailor our advertising campaign to be more efficient. We should focus on sending coupons to people that fit these ideal characteristics if possible - visit coffee houses regularly, driving to no urgent destination, and have either friend(s) or partner as their passenger. Obviously it will be impossible to identify who fits these categories all the time, but knowing that these types of people accept the coupons more often will help us tailor our advertising campaign. Coupons should be sent out mainly around 10 AM and 2 PM, and other times like 7 AM, 6 PM, and 10 PM should be avoided. Also, coupons should have 1 day expiration times, not 2 hours. There's also potential for experimentation with longer expiration times, to see the effect of that.
